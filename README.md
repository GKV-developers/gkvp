# GyroKinetic Vlasov simulation code: GKV

GKV is an Vlasov simulation code based on delta-f gyrokinetic equations in a local flux-tube geometry. The code has been developed for analyzing plasma turbulence in magnetized plasmas, such as magnetic fusion and magnetosphere. The released version includes several key features: kinetic electrons/ions/impurities, electromagnetic fluctuations, MHD equilibrium interfaces, and a multi-species collision operator. The computational performance has been confirmed to achieve excellent strong scaling up to ~0.6 million cores.
