%%% How to run the code %%%

1. make
2. ./shoot start_num end_num (JOB_ID)

   Examples: Single job submission (First, *.001)       -  ./shoot 1 1
             Single job submission (Second, *.002)      -  ./shoot 2 2
             Step job submission (from Third to Fifth)  -  ./shoot 3 5
             Sequential job submission                  -  ./shoot 6 7 11223
             (It is the case that there is a Fifth job in queue having 
              JOB_ID=11223, and you continue step jobs from Sixth to Seventh)



%%% For multi-platforms %%%

1. Create "shoot", "Makefile" and "sub.q" in "run/", which have already been
   prepared for helios(IFERC), k(RIKEN), ps(NIFS), nu(Nagoya), oakleaf(Tokyo).
2. Set the directory for output "DIR" in "shoot".
3. Set node number, elapsed time limit, and so on in "sub.q".
4. Compile and run the code.
